In the coffee brewing metaphor for article writing, the "in-the-sink" state could mean that the article is no longer relevant or useful to its intended audience. Just as coffee that has been left in the sink has lost its value and must be discarded, an article that is in the sink has failed to generate interest or provide value to readers.

An article may end up in the sink for several reasons. For example, the topic may no longer be relevant, or the writer may have failed to communicate their ideas effectively. Alternatively, the article may have been poorly written or structured, making it challenging to read or understand. Regardless of the reason, when an article is in the sink, it has lost its potential to create positive impact and inspire action.

The epistemic status of my notes falls into five non-linear levels: [[./Roasting|Roasting]] -> [[./Grinding|Grinding]] -> [[./Brewing|Brewing]] -> [[./Serving|Serving]] -> [[./Over-extracted|Over-extracted]] -> [[In-the-sink|In-the-sink]]
