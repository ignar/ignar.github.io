Once the coffee is brewed, it's time to serve it up and share it with others. Similarly, once the article is published, it's time to promote it and share it with the intended audience. Serving represents the ultimate goal of the writing process, where the writer's ideas are shared with others and hopefully make a positive impact.

The epistemic status of my notes falls into five non-linear levels: [[Roasting]] -> [[Grinding]] -> [[Brewing]] -> [[Serving]] -> [[Over-extracted]] -> [[In-the-sink]]
