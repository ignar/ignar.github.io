Once the coffee beans are roasted, they need to be ground into a finer consistency to create the perfect brew. Similarly, once the writer has a solid foundation for the article, it's time to start grinding away at the details and refining the language. This involves fleshing out ideas, developing the structure of the piece, and making sure that everything is flowing smoothly.

The epistemic status of my notes falls into five non-linear levels: [[./Roasting|Roasting]] -> [[Grinding|Grinding]] -> [[./Brewing|Brewing]] -> [[./Serving|Serving]] -> [[./Over-extracted|Over-extracted]] -> [[./In-the-sink|In-the-sink]]
