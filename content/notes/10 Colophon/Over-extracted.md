In the coffee brewing metaphor for article writing, "over-extracted" refers to a state in which the writer has spent too much time and effort refining and revising the article. Similar to over-extracting coffee, over-extracting an article can lead to a negative outcome. In the case of an article, over-extraction can result in a lack of clarity and a surplus of information, making it challenging for readers to understand the main point of the piece.

When an article is over-extracted, it can become overly complicated, convoluted, or excessively long. This issue can stem from the writer's desire to include too much detail or too many irrelevant points. Over-extraction can also occur when a writer becomes too attached to their work, continually revising and refining, to the point where the article loses its original intent and focus.

The epistemic status of my notes falls into five non-linear levels: [[Roasting]] -> [[Grinding]] -> [[Brewing]] -> [[Serving]] -> [[Over-extracted]] -> [[In-the-sink]]
