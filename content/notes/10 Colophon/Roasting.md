Just as coffee beans need to be roasted to unlock their full flavor potential, an article needs to be researched and developed before it can be fully realized. Roasting represents the early stages of the writing process, where the writer is gathering information, outlining ideas, and conducting research. This is the stage where the writer is exploring the topic and setting the foundation for the article.

The epistemic status of my notes falls into five non-linear levels: [[Roasting]] -> [[Grinding]] -> [[Brewing]] -> [[Serving]] -> [[Over-extracted]] -> [[In-the-sink]]
