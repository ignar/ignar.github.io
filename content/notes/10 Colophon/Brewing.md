When the coffee beans are ground, it's time to start brewing into a cup and enjoy it. Similarly, when the article is fully developed, it's time to share it with the world. Brewing represents the final stages of the writing process, where the writer is polishing the piece, double-checking for errors, and preparing it for publication.

The epistemic status of my notes falls into five non-linear levels: [[./Roasting|Roasting]] -> [[./Grinding|Grinding]] -> [[Brewing|Brewing]] -> [[./Serving|Serving]] -> [[./Over-extracted|Over-extracted]] -> [[./In-the-sink|In-the-sink]]
