## Steps you can take to prioritize these types of tasks:

1.  Identify urgent tasks: Urgent tasks are those that require immediate attention and cannot be postponed. These tasks usually have a deadline or a consequence for not completing them in a timely manner.
2.  Identify important tasks: Important tasks are those that contribute to your long-term goals and objectives. These tasks may not have an immediate deadline, but they are crucial for achieving your desired outcomes.
3.  Determine the impact: Consider the impact of each task on your goals and objectives. Urgent tasks may have a short-term impact, while important tasks may have a more significant impact on your long-term success.
4.  Rank the tasks: Rank the tasks based on their urgency and importance. You can use a prioritization matrix, such as the Eisenhower matrix, to help you rank tasks based on their urgency and importance.
5.  Take action: Once you have prioritized your tasks, focus on completing the most urgent and important tasks first. If you have multiple urgent tasks, consider delegating or postponing non-essential tasks to ensure you can complete the critical ones.

By prioritizing urgent vs important tasks, you can make better use of your time, reduce stress, and achieve your goals more efficiently.

## Eisenhower matrix

The Eisenhower matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, is a prioritization tool that helps you categorize tasks based on their urgency and importance. The matrix was named after former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was known for his effective time management skills.

The Eisenhower matrix consists of four quadrants, as follows:

1.  Urgent and Important: These tasks require immediate attention and have a significant impact on your goals and objectives. Examples of tasks in this quadrant include meeting deadlines, responding to urgent emails, and addressing critical issues.
2.  Important but Not Urgent: These tasks are important for achieving your long-term goals but don't require immediate attention. Examples of tasks in this quadrant include strategic planning, goal setting, and skill development.
3.  Urgent but Not Important: These tasks require immediate attention but have little impact on your long-term goals. Examples of tasks in this quadrant include attending meetings, answering non-critical emails, and handling routine tasks.
4.  Not Urgent and Not Important: These tasks have little to no impact on your goals and objectives and can be postponed or delegated. Examples of tasks in this quadrant include scrolling through social media, watching TV, and engaging in non-productive activities.

To use the Eisenhower matrix, list your tasks and categorize them into one of the four quadrants based on their urgency and importance. Then, focus on completing the tasks in Quadrant 1 first, followed by those in Quadrant 2. You can delegate or postpone tasks in Quadrants 3 and 4 to free up more time for the critical tasks in Quadrants 1 and 2.

The Eisenhower matrix is a simple yet effective tool for prioritizing your tasks and managing your time more efficiently.

## What to do when it is just a lot

When you have a lot of tasks to do, but they all seem equally important or you're unsure which ones to prioritize, one technique you can use is to box the effort and focus on completing smaller, more manageable tasks first. Here's how:

1.  Break down the tasks: Take each task and break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This will help you see progress and feel more motivated as you complete each sub-task.
2.  Estimate the effort: Estimate the effort required for each sub-task. This will help you prioritize the tasks based on the amount of time and resources required to complete them.
3.  Focus on completing smaller tasks: Focus on completing smaller, less time-consuming tasks first. This will help you build momentum and feel more productive as you check off completed tasks from your to-do list.
4.  Evaluate the importance: As you complete the smaller tasks, re-evaluate the importance of the remaining tasks. This will help you identify which tasks are truly important and require your immediate attention.
5.  Prioritize the remaining tasks: Once you have a clearer understanding of which tasks are most important, prioritize them based on their urgency and impact on your goals.

By breaking down tasks, estimating effort, and focusing on completing smaller tasks first, you can make progress and build momentum towards completing larger, more important tasks. This technique can also help you manage your time more effectively and reduce overwhelm when you have a lot of tasks to complete.
