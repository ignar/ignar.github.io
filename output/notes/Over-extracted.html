          <p>In the coffee brewing metaphor for article writing, “over-extracted” refers to a state in which the writer has spent too much time and effort refining and revising the article. Similar to over-extracting coffee, over-extracting an article can lead to a negative outcome. In the case of an article, over-extraction can result in a lack of clarity and a surplus of information, making it challenging for readers to understand the main point of the piece.</p>

<p>When an article is over-extracted, it can become overly complicated, convoluted, or excessively long. This issue can stem from the writer’s desire to include too much detail or too many irrelevant points. Over-extraction can also occur when a writer becomes too attached to their work, continually revising and refining, to the point where the article loses its original intent and focus.</p>
