          <p>The idea of a death march in product management refers to a project where the goals, timelines, or resources are so unrealistic that the project team is essentially “marching to their death” trying to complete it.</p>

<p>In a death march project, the team is typically overworked, stressed, and under extreme pressure to meet unrealistic deadlines or achieve impossible goals. This often leads to burnout, high turnover rates, and a decreased quality of work.</p>

<p>While death marches are sometimes seen as a necessary evil in product management, they are generally considered to be detrimental to both the team and the final product. Successful product management involves setting realistic goals, timelines, and resource allocations, and managing the project in a way that supports the team’s well-being and fosters high-quality work.</p>
